SQL-Challenge
You have been working as a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) for two weeks, and your first major assignment is a research project on employees who worked there during the 1980s and 1990s. The only available records from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you will design tables to store the data from these CSV files, import them into a SQL database, and analyze the information by answering specific queries. This will involve data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

1.Data Modeling:
  You will create an Entity Relationship Diagram. 

2. Data Engineering:
  You will create a table schema for each of the sux CSV files.

3. Data Analysis:
   You will run a number of queries to answer business questions.
